We held our inaugural event as a Kavli Science Focus Meeting at KICC, titled *"CamGW: Surveying the range of gravitational-wave science in Cambridge"*.
The day featured a series of excellent talks and panel discussions, and we were pleased to have over forty participants from across CamGW's affiliated departments.
