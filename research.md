# Research Themes and Activities

## Overview

CamGW researchers work on a wide range of topics in gravitational wave science, from theoretical developments to data analysis and astrophysical interpretation.

## Research Themes

### Gravitational Wave Theory

Research on the theoretical foundations of gravitational waves, including general relativity, alternative theories of gravity, and fundamental physics tests.

### Numerical Relativity

Computational simulations of gravitational wave sources, including binary black hole mergers, neutron star collisions, and other extreme astrophysical events.

### Data Analysis

Development and application of data analysis techniques for gravitational wave detectors, including signal processing, parameter estimation, and statistical methods.

### Astrophysics of Compact Objects

Study of black holes, neutron stars, and other compact objects as gravitational wave sources, including their formation, evolution, and properties.

### Detector Science

Research on improving gravitational wave detectors, including quantum noise reduction, optical systems, and future detector concepts.

### Multi-Messenger Astronomy

Combining gravitational wave observations with electromagnetic and neutrino observations to gain a comprehensive understanding of astrophysical events.

### Cosmology

Using gravitational waves to probe the early universe, dark energy, and the expansion history of the cosmos.

## Current Projects
